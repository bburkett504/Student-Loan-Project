# Student-Loan-Project
Student Loan Analysis Project
## Introduction
This is a Microsoft Excel project on analysis of student loan data collected from [Data.gov](https://data.gov/).
The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) is the national database of information about loans and grants awarded to students. The file [here](https://github.com/bburkett504/Student-Loan-Project/files/13505568/PortfolioSummary.1.xls) contains the original data.

The project is to clean and transform the data from the original excel form and prepare it for a more in depth analysis. Read further for results.

**_Disclaimer_**: _All datasets and report do not represent any company, institution or country, but just a sample/dummy dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of Excel.

## Problem Statement
Attached excel file is not in the best format for data analysis. 
That said, I would like to complete the following:
1. Analyze Student Loan Data for trends and determine
2. Determine how much many students have outstanding student loan debt between 2013-2022 (10 year)
3. Determine how much money is outstanding for these loans over this ten year period
4. Complete transformations without losing any source data
5. Automate this task for use on similar files

## Skills/concepts demonstrated
- The following Excel feat
- Table/Range creation
- Custom PowerQuery Code
- Nested Let statement
- Unpivot
- PivotChart
- Chart formatting
## Modeling:
Single source table was normalized for simpler analysis.
